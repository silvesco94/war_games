## About Us

Ethan and Scott are lifelong sports enthusiasts and longtime friends with a shared background in analytics and a fascination with the deeper layers of sports performance.

After many spirited debates over clutch hitting, situational efficiency, and whether playoff Jimmy Butler is a statistical anomaly or an emerging archetype, we came to a conclusion:

It’s time to put data at the center of the conversation.

This blog serves as our analytical playground — a platform to explore bold claims, scrutinize assumptions, and apply rigorous statistical thinking to the unpredictability of sports. Whether we're validating postseason legends, challenging the narrative around elite closers, or building models to evaluate high-impact players across leagues, our goal is the same: ground every insight in evidence.

Our mission:

> **No more “just trust me.” Only: “trust me, here’s the data.”**

Expect Python-driven analysis, unconventional questions, cross-sport comparisons, and the occasional statistical deep dive. If it’s overlooked, complex, or controversial — we’re probably working on it.
